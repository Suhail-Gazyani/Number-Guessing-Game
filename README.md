# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A beginner-friendly Python command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected number within a limited number of attempts.

## 🧩 About the Project

This simple game is designed for those who are just starting with Python. It teaches the basics of:

- Random number generation
- Loops and conditionals
- User input handling
- Error checking
- Console-based interaction

## 🕹️ How to Play

- The game chooses a number between **1 and 100**.
- You have **10 attempts** to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, you receive a hint:
  - **🔼 Too low**
  - **🔽 Too high**
  - **✅ Correct!**
- If you fail to guess within 10 attempts, the game ends and reveals the number.
